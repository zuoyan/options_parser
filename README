options parser for C++0x
=======================

This's a C++0x library for parsing options/command line arguments. Every option
is viewed as Match, Take, and Document. Generally, Match is a function from
current state(Position and Arguments) to newer state and Priority without side
effects. Take is a function from current state to newer state with side
effects. Document is used to show help message, or parsing error.

This library has simpified routines for general match and take, see
options_parser_test.cc and apt.cc for usage examples.

Consideration
--------------

Match can be any functions, not just string match, and Take can be any
functions, not just assignments. I think, this approach is more flexible than
gflags, and getopt.

One of most used limits of options is order independent. But this library
processing options in order and stopped at first not konwn/failed options.

The most powerful design for options processing is using a real dynamic parser,
or parser DSL library. User just defines whole the syntax with embeded
actions. But this's a little hard to implement and even harder, i think, to make
it easy to use.
